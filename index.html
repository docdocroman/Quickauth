                <p>This is a authentification concept initially created for a mobile application
                    <sup>(
                        <strong>Five Seconds</strong>, not available yet)</sup>.</p>
                <p>This concept allows to keep user logic in an application (any kind) but remove the "sign up", "sign in" system for the user. More friendly for the user, simple to integrate in code and the same "user logic" in your app.</p>

                    The classic auth concept (email / password) is easy to develop and everyone know how it works but it have many problems.
                    
                    <br/><br/>
                    
                    - Many people use an unsophisticated password. Easy to find or to hack.
                    <br/><br/>
                    - Not suitable for mobile interfaces. Time wasting, the users will remove the app. They will sign up only if they really want to use it. It's easy to loose a user because of this. But you can't remove it because you need to authentificate your users.
                    <br/><br/>
                    - Laborious to access to an app (any kind). The user must sign up and then, login. <strong>It takes too much time</strong>.

                        In this concept, we assume that the base of the digital identity of a person is his e-mail address.
                    
                        There is one single form used for sign up and login. In this form, we only ask for the email address.
                        
                        <br/><br/>
                        
                        <strong>If</strong> a user use the app for the first time, he just need to write his email and then, he is signed up and logged !
                        <br/>
                        <strong>Else</strong>, if he is already a user but unlogged, we send him a password generated in his email to authentificate him. Then, he is logged.
                        
                        <br/><br/>
                        
                        <em>In fact,</em> this concept is mainly designed for mobile application. Then, a user rarely logout on mobile. So, he just write his email one single time and he is sign up and logged in.
                        
                        <br/>

                    <p class="lead">
                        
                        The most important security breach is the user's email account. If someone hack his email, the hacker is able to login in your app. But the breach exists in the classical authentification concept with "I forgot my password". Then, it's the same as before.
                        
                        <br/><br/>
                        
                        - The password sent by email can be used one single time. It's generated when the users wants to login.
                        <br/>
                        - The password can't (or not easely) be attacked by brute-force because it's sophisticated.
                        
                        <br/><br/>
                        
                        <em>In fact</em>, I think this system can be used for most of the mobile application but for security reasons, I dont think it's a good idea for application that contains sensitive informations.

                    <p class="lead">
                    With this authentification concept, the time until the moment when the user launch the application and the moment when he uses it is <strong>really quick</strong>. The user can't be discouraged because of the authentification process. In most of the cases, you user will never logout and will never use the email authentification process. Maybe if he wants to use his account on another device.

                        Technically, you can code this concept the same way you could do with a classic auth system. Using an API or not. Most importantly, with this you keep a "user logic" in your code. If you want more information about the user, you can ask him later but not during the sign up process.
